The PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal is a useful control solution in wide application field. It can used on motor driving, fan control, backlight brightness tuning, LED light dimming, or simulating as a simple digital to analog converter output through a low pass filter circuit.
The MS51 PWM is especially designed for motor control by providing three pairs, maximum 16-bit resolution of PWM output with programmable period and duty. The architecture makes user easy to drive the one-phase or three-phase brushless DC motor (BLDC), or three-phase AC induction motor. Each of six PWM can be configured as one of independent mode, complementary mode, or synchronous mode. If the complementary mode is used, a programmable dead-time insertion is available to protect MOS turn-on simultaneously. The PWM waveform can be edge-aligned or center-aligned with variable interrupt points.
